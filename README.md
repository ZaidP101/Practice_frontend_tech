    <h1>Exploring HTML and CSS Through Creative Projects</h1>
    <p>In this Git repository, I've explored various aspects of HTML and CSS by working on some fun and educational mini-projects. These projects were created as part of my personal learning journey to deepen my understanding of web development.</p>
    
    <h2>Project 1: Shape Creations</h2>
    <p>In this project, I experimented with creating different shapes using HTML and CSS. It's a simple yet effective way to understand how CSS properties can be manipulated to achieve various visual effects.</p>
    
    <h2>Project 2: Hover Effects</h2>
    <p>This mini-project focuses on hover effects. When you hover your cursor over the shapes, their colors change, providing an interactive experience. It's a demonstration of how CSS transitions can enhance user interactions.</p>
    
    <h2>Project 3: DevOps Roadmap Cards</h2>
    <p>In this project, I've designed a set of cards that, when hovered over, bring the images to the top of the deck. These images represent a roadmap for beginners in DevOps, offering a visual guide to get started. This project combines both HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing and informative tool.</p>
    
    <p>Each of these projects showcases my growing skills in HTML and CSS and my passion for web development. Feel free to explore the code and see how these effects are achieved!</p>
