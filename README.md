# Exploring HTML and CSS Through Creative Projects

In this Git repository, I've explored various aspects of HTML and CSS by working on some fun and educational mini-projects. These projects were created as part of my personal learning journey to deepen my understanding of web development.

## Shape Creations

In this project, I experimented with creating different shapes using HTML and CSS. It's a simple yet effective way to understand how CSS properties can be manipulated to achieve various visual effects.

## Project 1: Hover Effects

This mini-project focuses on hover effects. When you hover your cursor over the shapes, their colors change, providing an interactive experience. It's a demonstration of how CSS transitions can enhance user interactions.

## Project 2: DevOps Roadmap Cards

In this project, I've designed a set of cards that, when hovered over, bring the images to the top of the deck. These images represent a roadmap for beginners in DevOps, offering a visual guide to get started. This project combines both HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing and informative tool.

## Project 3: Interactive Square Elements

This project features interactive square elements that respond to mouse events. Each square has unique behaviors on hover and click, demonstrating the use of JavaScript to create dynamic and engaging web interactions.

- Square 1: Displays a random number on hover and reverts to "1" when the mouse leaves.
- Square 2: Toggles between red and green backgrounds with text color changes on hover.
- Square 3: Changes to a random background color on hover with contrasting text color.
- Square 4: On click, changes the background color of all squares and itself to various colors, and displays "Again!!". Reverts to original colors and text on mouse leave.


This project showcases the combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enhance user interaction and visual feedback.

## Project 4: Dynamic Image Cards

In this project, I've created a dynamic gallery of image cards using JavaScript. Each card is randomly assigned an image from a predefined set of DevOps-related icons. This project demonstrates how to use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and create visually engaging content dynamically.

## Features

- Random Image Assignment: Each card displays a randomly selected image from a set of DevOps-related icons, including Linux, Git, Python, Docker, Jenkins, AWS, Kubernetes, Ansible, Terraform, and a Refresh icon.
- Dynamic Content Generation: JavaScript is used to dynamically create and insert 44 image cards into the main container element on the webpage.
- Refresh for New Images: The images are randomly assigned each time the page is loaded, so you can refresh the website to see a new set of images.
- Image Gallery: A set of 44 cards is generated, each displaying a random image from the following set: Linux, Git, Python, Docker, Jenkins, AWS, Kubernetes, Ansible, Terraform, and a Refresh icon.

## Technology Used

- HTML: For the structure of the webpage.
- CSS: For styling the image cards.
- JavaScript: For dynamically generating and assigning images to the cards.
